# Learn Go

Files produced while learning go.

## Setup

To run any of these examples, you will want to clone this repository into your go directory (`go env GOPATH`) under `src` folder.

Then, for example, you can compile an example, like `hello`, by `cd` into the directory and running `go install`, then running `hello` (must have go bin directory on the path first though).
